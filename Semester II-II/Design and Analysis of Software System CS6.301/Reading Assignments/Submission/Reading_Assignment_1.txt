    Software process is a set of activities, methods, practices, and transformations used to develop and maintain software and associated products.
    The software development process involves translating user needs into requirements, design, code, testing and installation.
    The objective of software development is efficient integration in real-life situations.
    Various software development methods have been adopted such as waterfall, iterative and incremental, spiral, V model, rapid application development, prototyping, agile, and hybrid spiral.
    Adherence to a suitable life cycle model helps to produce good quality products.
    Mainly there are four phase of software development: software requirement, software design, software coding/implementation, and software testing.
    These phases have an individual impact on software quality attributes and play an important role to improve quality in finished products.
    A suitable life cycle model can be selected based on an analysis of issues such as: characteristics of the software to be developed, characteristic of development team, and characteristics of the customer.
    Failure of many software projects has led to software quality becoming a key issue for all stakeholders.
    The objective of the paper is to present a review on the impact of software development process on software quality.
