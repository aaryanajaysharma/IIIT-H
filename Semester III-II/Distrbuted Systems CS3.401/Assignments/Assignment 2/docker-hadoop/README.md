# Changes

Version 2.0.0 introduces uses wait_for_it script for the cluster startup

# Hadoop Docker

## Quick Start

It is recommended to mount a local directory to the namenode to make working inside the docker container easier. You'll be able to learn about it [here](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/#use-a-bind-mount-with-compose).

To deploy an example HDFS cluster, run:
```
  docker-compose up -d
```

Run example wordcount job:
```
  make wordcount
```

Or deploy in swarm:
```
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose-v3.yml hadoop
```

`docker-compose` creates a docker network that can be found by running `docker network list`, e.g. `dockerhadoop_default`.

Run `docker network inspect` on the network (e.g. `dockerhadoop_default`) to find the IP the hadoop interfaces are published on. Access these interfaces with the following URLs:

* Namenode: http://<dockerhadoop_IP_address>:9870/dfshealth.html#tab-overview
* History server: http://<dockerhadoop_IP_address>:8188/applicationhistory
* Datanode: http://<dockerhadoop_IP_address>:9864/
* Nodemanager: http://<dockerhadoop_IP_address>:8042/node
* Resource manager: http://<dockerhadoop_IP_address>:8088/

Once deployed, run `docker ps` and ensure that the containers are healthy. If they appear to be unhealthy, you can read the logs by using the command `docker logs <container-id>`.

To exec into the namenode, run `docker exec -it namenode /bin/bash`

## Common issues

- "Library initialization failed - unable to allocate file descriptor table" (often resulting in namenode restarting)
  You can follow the instructions present [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68776387/docker-library-initialization-failed-unable-to-allocate-file-descriptor-tabl)
- Resource manager keeps restarting because the namenode is in safemode
  - Exec into the namenode and run `hdfs dfsadmin -safemode leave`
  - Then, run `hdfs fsck -delete`

## Configure Environment Variables

The configuration parameters can be specified in the hadoop.env file or as environmental variables for specific services (e.g. namenode, datanode etc.):
```
  CORE_CONF_fs_defaultFS=hdfs://namenode:8020
```

CORE_CONF corresponds to core-site.xml. fs_defaultFS=hdfs://namenode:8020 will be transformed into:
```
  <property><name>fs.defaultFS</name><value>hdfs://namenode:8020</value></property>
```
To define dash inside a configuration parameter, use triple underscore, such as YARN_CONF_yarn_log___aggregation___enable=true (yarn-site.xml):
```
  <property><name>yarn.log-aggregation-enable</name><value>true</value></property>
```

The available configurations are:
* /etc/hadoop/core-site.xml CORE_CONF
* /etc/hadoop/hdfs-site.xml HDFS_CONF
* /etc/hadoop/yarn-site.xml YARN_CONF
* /etc/hadoop/httpfs-site.xml HTTPFS_CONF
* /etc/hadoop/kms-site.xml KMS_CONF
* /etc/hadoop/mapred-site.xml  MAPRED_CONF

If you need to extend some other configuration file, refer to base/entrypoint.sh bash script.
